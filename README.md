Make async requests to NetSuite SuiteTalk SOAP/REST Web Services and Restlets

## Beta quality disclaimer

The project's API is still very much in fluctuation. Please consider pinning your dependency to this package to a minor version (e.g. `poetry add netsuite~0.9` or `pipenv install netsuite~=0.9.0`), which is guaranteed to have no breaking changes. From 1.0 and forward we will keep a stable API.

## Installation

With default features (REST API + Restlet support):

    pip install netsuite

With Web Services SOAP API support:

    pip install netsuite[soap_api]

With CLI support:

    pip install netsuite[cli]

With `orjson` package (faster JSON handling):

    pip install netsuite[orjson]

With all features:

    pip install netsuite[all]
